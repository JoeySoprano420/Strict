Who will use Strict?

Systems & infra engineers who want native performance and deterministic builds.

Safety-critical developers (finance, aerospace, automotive, med-tech) who need explicit control, audits, and guardrails.

Backend & platform teams building high-reliability services and CLIs with minimal runtime overhead.

Educators & students who want pseudocode-clear syntax that still compiles to fast native code.

Security & compliance teams that favor explicit flow, assertions, and verifiable outputs.

Data & quant engineers needing low-latency pipelines with guarded arithmetic.

What will it be used for?

High-reliability services: control planes, schedulers, queues, config/secret managers, audit pipelines.

Low-latency components: gateways, proxies, telemetry shippers, data-plane filters.

Batch/ETL & analytics kernels with tight loops and predictable CPU behavior.

CLI tools that start fast, ship as a single native binary, and have few external deps.

Embedded/edge utilities where footprint, determinism, and safety checks matter.

Financial/risk engines that benefit from Safe.* arithmetic and explicit flow.

Education: teaching algorithmic thinking with If/Then/End, Match, For, Func.

Industries & sectors likely to gravitate to it

Finance/FinTech, Aerospace/Automotive, Industrial IoT, Telecom/Networking, Defense, Healthcare IT, Gov/Regulated environments, Cloud & DevOps platforms, and Academia.

Real-world things you can build

APIs & microservices with strict request validation and low overhead.

Stream processors (log enrichment, metric aggregation, alerting).

CNC/PLC control helpers and edge device supervisors.

Trading venue adapters and risk calculators using Safe.Div, Safe.Add.

Command-line suites (packagers, linters, generators) with instant startup.

High-performance libraries exposed via C ABI to other ecosystems.

Learning curve (expected)

On-ramp: very fast. The Let/If/Then/End/Match/Func style reads like structured pseudocode.

Intermediate: understanding the safety ops and pattern matching idioms.

Advanced: OOP/Generics/Templates/Concurrency and DGM/LLVM mapping. Still simpler than mastering C++ templates or Rust‚Äôs borrow checker, but more ‚Äúsystems-aware‚Äù than Python/JS.

Interoperability

What languages interoperate? Any language that can call a C ABI function. That includes C, C++, Rust, Zig, Go (cgo), Python (ctypes/cffi), Java/Kotlin (JNI), C# (P/Invoke), and more.

How does interop work?

Expose Strict functions as extern "C"-style signatures during codegen.

Link with system linkers; ship as shared libs (.so/.dylib/.dll) or static libs.

Call out to C/C++ libs with straightforward FFI (no hidden runtime).

How interoperable? High. Strict compiles to plain native code with a minimal runtime and a stable C boundary.

Purposes & use cases (including edge cases)

Primary: deterministic services, native CLIs, low-latency components, safety-checked compute kernels.

Edge:

Air-gapped builds (auditable IR/DGM/ASM artifacts).

Regulated pipelines (prove safety checks exist; archive .ll and .dgm).

Constrained environments (fast cold-start, tiny RSS, no heavy VM).

‚ÄúLast-mile‚Äù acceleration: rewrite hot paths called from higher-level stacks.

What Strict can do right now

Compile to native via LLVM IR ‚Üí NASM x64, producing a single executable.

Core language: Let, expressions, If/Else, For/While, Func/Return, Match, Print, Input.

Safety ops: Safe.Add/Sub/Mul/Div/Shift (guarded arithmetic).

Data structures: Lists/Arrays with bounds helpers in the runtime.

OOP: Classes, fields, methods, inheritance, encapsulation, basic polymorphism.

Generics & templates: Parametric types and compile-time expansion.

Concurrency: Future, Parallel, Sync (deterministic joins).

Artifacts: Emit .ll, .dgm, .s alongside the final binary for auditability.

When is Strict preferred over others?

When you want readable, explicit control flow and native performance.

When overflow/guarded math and exhaustive decision logic must be first-class.

When you need instant startup and small, dependency-light deliverables.

When auditability matters (keep IR/ASM trail for compliance).

When integrating at the C ABI boundary with existing systems.

Where Strict shines

Low-latency services (proxies, API edges, order routers).

Compute kernels with tight loops, where safety and speed both matter.

Security-sensitive utilities with minimal attack surface and explicit checks.

Educational settings: teach algorithms and systems thinking with real compilation.

Where it can out-perform others

Startup time & footprint vs. VM/bytecode languages (JVM/.NET/Node).

CPU-bound hot paths vs. dynamic languages (Python/Ruby/JS).

Auditability & determinism vs. languages with large opaque runtimes.

Safety by default vs. C/C++ when arithmetic errors and unchecked logic are risks.

Where it shows the most potential

Becoming the ‚Äúpseudocode you can ship‚Äù language for regulated, high-reliability software.

A teaching-to-production bridge: students learn structured logic that compiles into real, fast binaries.

What‚Äôs next (evolution)

Richer pattern matching (guards, destructuring for user types).

Ownership & region analysis for stronger memory safety without GC.

First-class async/await on top of Future/Parallel.

WASM target and arm64 backends alongside x64.

Package manager (SPM) with reproducible lockfiles and supply-chain attestations.

Formal spec + verifier for the DGM mapping (machine-checkable semantics).

Where is Strict most needed?

Finance & risk, aerospace/automotive control, industrial automation, healthcare IT, telecom core, government‚Äîanywhere that requires explainable, auditable, fast software.

Performance notes

How fast to load / start up? Native-binary fast (no VM warm-up). Typical CLI/services start in milliseconds.

Throughput/latency? Competitive with hand-tuned C/C++ for CPU-bound sections; predictable GC-free latency profile.

Security & safety

Why secure? Minimal runtime surface, explicit control flow, no dynamic JIT, no reflection by default.

How safe? Guarded arithmetic (Safe.*), bounds helpers, exhaustive Match, Assert, Defer, compile-time diagnostics, and auditable IR/DGM/ASM outputs.

Comparisons (thumbnail)

vs C: far clearer control flow + safe ops + match; similar performance.

vs C++: simpler mental model; fewer foot-guns; no gigantic runtime; easier audit trail.

vs Rust: friendlier on-ramp and simpler syntax; less rigorous ownership at present (future work may add region/ownership analysis).

vs Go: lower overhead and faster startup; more explicit control; fewer batteries included (by design).

vs Python/JS: vastly faster and lower latency; compiled; but fewer dynamic conveniences (deliberate trade-off).

Why choose Strict?

Clarity by design (human-readable, audit-friendly).

Safety as a feature (not a library).

Performance without VM baggage.

Interop that just works (C ABI, link everything).

Deterministic artifacts you can ship, sign, and explain.

Why was Strict created?

To collapse the gap between pseudocode clarity and production performance. Teams were either writing unreadable low-level code or readable high-level code with heavy runtime costs and fuzzy guarantees. Strict‚Äôs thesis: you can have clear logic + fearless execution in one language‚Äîno compromise.
